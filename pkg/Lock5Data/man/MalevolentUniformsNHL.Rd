\format{
  A dataset with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \tabular{rl}{
    \code{NHLTeam} \tab {Team name}\cr
    \code{NHL_Malevolence} \tab {Score reflecting the "malevolence" of a team's uniform}\cr
    \code{ZPenMin} \tab {Z-score for penalty minutes}\cr
  }
}
\details{
Participants with no knowledge of the teams rated the jerseys 
on characteristics such as timid/aggressive, nice/mean and good/bad. The averages of these responses
produced a "malevolence" index with higher scores signifying impressions of more malevolent uniforms. To
measure aggressiveness, the authors used the amount of penalty minutes converted to z-scores and averaged for each team over the seasons from 1970-1986.
